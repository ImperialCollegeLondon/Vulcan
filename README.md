# Vulcan
Hello there. Vulcan is my final year project. Its aim is to build an Agent Based Macroeconomic Modelling Framework from scratch with C++. It is still a work in progress, due to be completed in full by June 2023. I am aiming to get the "beta" version of the model working by late March. As such it doesn't look pretty or make much sense now. But rest assured- something nice is brewing!
