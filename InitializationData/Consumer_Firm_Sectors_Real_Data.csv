Notes
1,"Based on an analysis of variation in price changes between the individual items chosen to represent each division in the period 2018 to 2022. Improvements to the analysis have been made since our Consumer price inflation basket of goods and services: 2022 article, so comparison should not be made between years."
2,"These figures should be treated as providing only a broad indication of the allocation of items to the 12 CPIH divisions. For example, the sample of prices underpinning an existing item might easily be stratified in some way to form two or more distinct items; conversely, items could be merged to form a single item representing a wider, more heterogeneous, spending category. A specific example of this is the item ""UK university tuition fees"". This is classified as one item, but the index takes into account prices for undergraduate, postgraduate and part-time courses."
